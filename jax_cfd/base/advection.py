def _advect_aligned(cs: GridVariableVector, v: GridVariableVector) -> GridArray:
  """Computes fluxes and the associated advection for aligned `cs` and `v`.

  The values `cs` should consist of a single quantity `c` that has been
  interpolated to the offset of the components of `v`. The components of `v` and
  `cs` should be located at the faces of a single (possibly offset) grid cell.
  We compute the advection as the divergence of the flux on this control volume.

  The boundary condition on the flux is inherited from the scalar quantity `c`.

  A typical example in three dimensions would have

  ```
  cs[0].offset == v[0].offset == (1., .5, .5)
  cs[1].offset == v[1].offset == (.5, 1., .5)
  cs[2].offset == v[2].offset == (.5, .5, 1.)

  In this case, the returned advection term would have offset `(.5, .5, .5)`.

  Args:
    cs: a sequence of `GridArray`s; a single value `c` that has been
      interpolated so that it is aligned with each component of `v`.
    v: a sequence of `GridArrays` describing a velocity field. Should be defined
      on the same Grid as cs.

  Returns:
    An `GridArray` containing the time derivative of `c` due to advection by

       control volume centered on `c`. In most cases satisfied by design.
    2. Computes upwind flux for each direction.
    3. Computes higher order flux correction based on neighboring values of `c`.
    4. Combines fluxes and assigns flux boundary condition.
    5. Returns the negative divergence of fluxes.
