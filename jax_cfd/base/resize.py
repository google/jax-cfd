  """Downsamples `u`, an array of velocities in the given `direction`.

  Downsampling consists of the following steps:
    * Establish new downsampled control volumes. Each will consist of
      `factor ** dimension` of the fine-grained control volumes.
    * Discard all of the `u` values that do not lie on a face of the new control
      volume in `direction`.
    * Compute the mean of all `u` values that lie on each control volume face in
      the given `direction`.

  This procedure guarantees that if our source velocity has zero divergence
  (i.e., corresponds to an incompressible flow), the downsampled velocity field
  also has zero divergence.

  For example,

  ```
  u = [[0, 1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6, 7],
       [8, 9, 10, 11],
       [12, 13, 14, 15]]
  w = downsample_velocity(u, direction=0, factor=2)

  assert w == np.array([[4.5, 6.5],
                        [12.5, 14.5]])
  ```

  Args:
    u: an array of velocity values.
    direction: an integer indicating the direction of the velocities `u`.
    factor: the factor by which to downsample.

  Returns:
    Coarse-grained array, reduced in size by ``factor`` along each dimension.
