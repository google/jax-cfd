"""Functions for approximating derivatives.

Finite difference methods operate on GridVariable and return GridArray.
Evaluating finite differences requires boundary conditions, which are defined
for a GridVariable. But the operation of taking a derivative makes the boundary
condition undefined, which is why the return type is GridArray.

For example, if the variable c has the boundary condition c_b = 0, and we take
the derivate dc/dx, then it is unclear what the boundary condition on dc/dx
should be. So programmatically, after taking finite differences and doing
operations, the user has to explicitly assign boundary conditions to the result.

Example:
  c = GridVariable(c_array, c_boundary_condition)
  dcdx = finite_differences.forward_difference(c)  # returns GridArray
  c_new = c + dt * (-velocity * dcdx)  # operations on GridArrays
  c_new = GridVariable(c_new, c_boundary_condition)  # assocaite BCs
