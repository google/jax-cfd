# JAX-CFD: Computational Fluid Dynamics in JAX

Authors: Dmitrii Kochkov, Jamie A. Smith, Peter Norgaard, Gideon Dresdner, Ayya Alieva, Stephan Hoyer

JAX-CFD is an experimental research project for exploring the potential of
machine learning, automatic differentiation and hardware accelerators (GPU/TPU)
for computational fluid dynamics. It is implemented in
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

To learn more about our general approach, read our paper [Machine learning accelerated computational fluid dynamics](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/21/e2101784118)
(PNAS 2021).

## Getting started

The "notebooks" directory contains several demonstrations of using the JAX-CFD
code.

- Demos of different simulation setups:
  - [2D simulation with FVM on a staggered grid](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/jax-cfd/blob/main/notebooks/demo.ipynb)
  - [2D simulation with a psuedo-spectral solver](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/jax-cfd/blob/main/notebooks/spectral_forced_turbulence.ipynb)
  - [2D simulation of channel flow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/jax-cfd/blob/main/notebooks/channel_flow_demo.ipynb)
  - [2D simulation with FVM on a collocated grid](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/jax-cfd/blob/main/notebooks/collocated_demo.ipynb) (experimental)

- Reproduce results from our PNAS paper:
  - [Data analysis and evaluation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/jax-cfd/blob/main/notebooks/ml_accelerated_cfd_data_analysis.ipynb)
  - [Running our pre-trained models](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/jax-cfd/blob/main/notebooks/ml_model_inference_demo.ipynb)

## Organization

JAX-CFD is organized around sub-modules:

- `jax_cfd.base`: core finite volume/difference methods for CFD, written in JAX.
- `jax_cfd.spectral`: core pseudospectral methods for CFD, written in JAX.
- `jax_cfd.ml`: machine learning augmented models for CFD,
  written in JAX and [Haiku](https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- `jax_cfd.data`: data processing utilities for preparing, evaluating and
  post-processing data created with JAX-CFD, written in
  [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/) and
  [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/).

A base install with `pip install jax-cfd` only requires NumPy, SciPy and JAX.
To install dependencies for the other submodules, use `pip install jax-cfd[ml]`,
`pip install jax-cfd[data]` or `pip install jax-cfd[complete]`.

## Numerics

JAX-CFD is currently focused on unsteady turbulent flows:

- *Spatial discretization*:
  - *Finite volume/difference* methods on a staggered grid (the "Arakawa C" or
  "MAC" grid) with pressure at the center of each cell and velocity components
  defined on corresponding faces.
  - *Pseudospectral* methods for vorticity which use anti-aliasing filtering
  techniques for non-linear terms to maintain stability.
- *Temporal discretization*: Currently only first-order temporal
  discretization, using explicit time-stepping for advection and either implicit
  or explicit time-stepping for diffusion.
- *Pressure solves*: Either CG or fast diagonalization with real-valued FFTs
  (suitable for periodic boundary conditions).
- *Boundary conditions*: Currently only periodic boundary conditions are
  supported.
- *Advection*: We implement 2nd order accurate "Van Leer" schemes.
- *Closures*: We currently implement Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity models.

TODO: add a notebook explaining our numerical models in more depth.

In the long term, we're interested in expanding JAX-CFD to implement methods
relevant for related research, e.g.,

- Colocated grids
- Alternative boundary conditions (e.g., non-periodic boundaries and immersed
  boundary methods)
- Higher order time-stepping
- Geometric multigrid
- Steady state simulation (e.g., RANS)
- Distributed simulations across multiple TPUs/GPUs

We would welcome collaboration on any of these! Please reach out (either on
GitHub or by email) to coordinate before starting significant work.
